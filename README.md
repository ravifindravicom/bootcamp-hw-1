## Homework Assignment 1

In this homework assignment I have refactored the sample Horiseon home page site by editing the index.html and style.css files. The primary changes I made include:
- Adding comments throughout both files
- Fixing one error in a link from the navigation tab
- Changing the class names to be more descriptive
- Using semantic tags
- Adding alt to the image tags for readability
- Reducing the number of classes to those I felt necessary 
- I chose to reduce font of footer


## Deployed To:
The resulting web page has been deployed to:
